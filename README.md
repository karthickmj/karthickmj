### ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm **Karthick M J**

Seasoned Senior Software Engineer with a passion for building scalable backend systems and full-stack applications. I have a solid track record at tech giants like **Amazon** and **Airbnb**.

During my tenure at **Airbnb**, I led the development of the Payments Authentication Gateway, a centralized service that now securely handles over several billions in payment volume annually.

Previously at **Amazon**, I was instrumental in enhancing the 3P and 1P device makers' developer experience of Amazon Common Software initiative. I contributed in building the ACS dashboard which enables ACS developers to build, configure, provision and manage their ACS devices at ease.

Even before that, I was part of **FireOS** performance team at **Amazon**, where I innovated to create a system service that improved app launch speeds and led the development of the Game Mode feature, which significantly increased user engagement metrics.

I'm currently building on top of Artificial Intelligence at Redex AI.
